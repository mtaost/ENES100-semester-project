This folder contains the work of the milestones which were graded key points of our project. A description of each milestone is shown below:

Milestone 1: A group presentation on team organization and initial design concepts
Milestone 2: A group presentation about more detailed design implementation including calculated figures on specs required to meet goals, parts sourced to implement design, and CAD drawings of how the OSV is to be structured. 
Milestone 3: Written writeup documenting implementation details such as locomotion methods, navigation algorithm, mission specific hardware. 
Milestone 4: Receipts proving parts have been ordered and task list for group members. 
Milestones 5-7: These were milestones where we demonstrated incremental progress of the construction of our OSV. We demonstrated functionality to professors such as locomotion, mission objective completion capability, obstacle avoidance, etc. 
Milestone 8: A poster created for a design showcase which shows the key points of our project and what it aimed to accomplish.
Milestone 9: Final written report of what was actually built and lessons we learned along the way.
