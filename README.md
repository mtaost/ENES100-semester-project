# ENES100 semester project
ENES 100 is an introduction class for all engineering majors and has students work in teams of 8 to construct an autonomous robotic vehicle to traverse a sand arena and complete a set of tasks.

As seen in the poster graphic, the arena was a closed off sandbox with two randomly placed rock obstacles and pre-placed objective sites. Some of the objectives were candles which had to be extinguished or blocks that had to be measured. As our team's mission was the chemical mission, our OSV (On Sand Vehicle) had to:

 - Navigate to the mission objective (a pool of water)
 - Measure the pH of the water and transmit it to the base station
 - Collect a 10-15mL sample of the water
 - Neutralize the pool of water to a pH of 6-8

The class was graded mostly on milestones throughout the class which included presentations and reports detailing our plan of attack as well as the final results. A more detailed description of each milestone can be found at [Milestones/README.md](https://github.com/mtaost/ENES100-semester-project/blob/master/Milestones/README.md) 
My role in this project was team captain so I had a large part in design decisions and task distribution. Ultimately our team succeeded in completing all of our mission objectives.
